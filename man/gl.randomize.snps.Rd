\title{Randomly changes the allocation of 0's and 2's in a genlight object}
\usage{
gl.randomize.snps(
  x,
  plot.display = TRUE,
  plot.theme = theme_dartR(),
  plot.colors = NULL,
  plot.file = NULL,
  plot.dir = NULL,

}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Name of the genlight object containing the SNP data [required].}

\item{plot.display}{If TRUE, resultant plots are displayed in the plot window
[default TRUE].}

\item{plot.theme}{Theme for the plot. See Details for options
[default theme_dartR()].}

\item{plot.colors}{List of two color names for the borders and fill of the
plots [default c("#2171B5","#6BAED6")].}

\item{plot.file}{Name for the RDS binary file to save (base name only, exclude extension) [default NULL]}

\item{plot.dir}{Directory to save the plot RDS files [default as specified 
by the global working directory or tempdir()]}

\item{verbose}{Verbosity: 0, silent or fatal errors; 1, begin and end; 2,
progress log ; 3, progress and results summary; 5, full report [default NULL,
unless specified using gl.set.verbosity].}

Returns a genlight object with half of the loci re-coded.

\description{
This function samples randomly half of the SNPs and re-codes, in the sampled
SNP's, 0's by 2's.

\details{
DArT calls the most common allele as the reference allele. In a genlight
object, homozygous for the reference allele are coded with a '0' and
homozygous for the alternative allele are coded with a '2'. This causes some
distortions in visuals from time to time.
If plot.display = TRUE, two smear plots (pre-randomisation and
post-randomisation) are presented using a random subset of individuals (10)
and loci (100) to provide an overview of the changes.
Resultant ggplots are saved to the session's temporary directory.
